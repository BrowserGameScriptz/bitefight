# Bitefight Clone Script (In Progress)

Bitefight clone version for study purposes. I am going to build a private server for this and planning to use phalcon framework. If you have any better idea open issue, leave comment etc etc I am not familiar with github discussions lol

Also if you are efficient on calculating formulas you can help me with grotte and tavern missions.

## Testing

Looking for some testers to work with me on weekends. We are going to finish basic version with only human hunt. Any help would be nice, thank you.

You can test script on: http://bf.osein.tk
