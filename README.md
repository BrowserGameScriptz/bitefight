# Bitefight Clone Script (In Progress)

Bitefight clone version for study purposes. I am going to build a private server for this and planning to use phalcon framework. If you have any better idea open issue, leave comment etc etc I am not familiar with github discussions lol

Also if you are efficient on calculating formulas you can help me with grotte and tavern missions.
